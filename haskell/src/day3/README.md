# Haskell - day 3

## Exercises
1. [Write a function](./assoc.hs) that uses *Maybe* monad and finds the value in the associative array.\
   Also, [Write a function](./assoc_nested.hs) that uses *Maybe* monad and finds the value by key in multiple nested associative array.
2. [Implement a labyrinth](./labyrinth.hs). Use custom types *Labyrinth* and *Node*.\
   *Node* should contain list of coordinates to other *Nodes*.
3. [Use a *List* monad](./labyrinth.hs) to solve the *Labyrinth*.

## My notes
As for now I'm not that good in pure functional programming
introduced to me by Haskell. \
I went through with very humble solutions for this day.
